For the implementation of this project, I conducted thorough research to understand the specific functionalities of the libc library functions. I referred to man pages to grasp their working mechanisms (including the function declaration and its arguments).

Regarding string manipulation functions (string.c), I iterated through each string character and performed the necessary comparisons or assignments. It's worth mentioning that functions like memcmp, memset, and memmove required casting to char* for data manipulation.

For io, stat, and mm functions, I utilized system calls. I researched the required parameters for each specific syscall and included validations for received arguments and potential errors (especially for file-related operations). The syscall numbers were obtained from the syscall_list.
